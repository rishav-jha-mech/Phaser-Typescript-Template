# Phaser 3.70.0 TypeScript Starter Template

Welcome to the Phaser 3 TypeScript Starter Template! This template provides a ready-to-use setup for developing Phaser games using TypeScript. Follow the steps below to get started:

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rishav-jha-mech/Phaser-Typescript-Template.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the cloned repository directory and install all the necessary packages using npm:

```sh
cd Phaser-Typescript-Template
npm install
```

### 3. Build and Run

After installing the dependencies, you can build and run the project. This command will compile your TypeScript files into JavaScript and start a development server that watches for changes:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you can run your public/index.html file using live server.

## Customizing the Template

Feel free to modify and customize the template according to your project requirements. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Game Development**: Start building your game by adding assets (images, sounds, etc.) to the assets directory and writing your game logic in TypeScript files under the src directory.

2. **Webpack Configuration**: Adjust the webpack configuration (webpack.config.js) to suit your project's needs. You can customize entry points, output paths, and other webpack settings as necessary.

3. **Phaser Configuration**: Modify the Phaser configuration in src/app.ts to set up your game's initial settings, such as the canvas size, physics settings, and more.

4. **tsconfig.json**: You can modify the tsconfig.json file to adjust TypeScript compiler options according to your project requirements.

5. **Prettier and Husky Hooks**: We use Prettier for code formatting and Husky for pre-commit hooks. Both can be customized by modifying the .prettierrc file and the husky configuration in package.json, respectively.
